      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center">This love story began in the spring of 2011. Meggi had taken the
      invitation to spend the spring/summer with her sister Britt in Calgary. So, she picked up everything she had in
      Southern Ontario and took advantage of the exciting opportunity.</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">Upon arriving in western Canada, Meg discovered the fantastic group of friends her sister had collected. But one, in particular, caught her eye!</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">Meggi and Elliot hit it off immediately. Their kindred passion for
      music, food, culture and a good IPA is what brought them together—it also took them on many adventures.</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">Having dated for only a few months, the two of them ventured down
      to Sasquatch Music Festival. It was during this trip a young Elliot let those three magical words slip!</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">When they got home from this trip, Meg filled Elliot in on what he
      had said (for some reason he couldn’t remember) and told him that she would be staying in Calgary with him!
      During the next couple of years Elliot and Meggi spent their time exploring Calgary and the Rocky Mountains.</p>

      Canmore">

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">In 2014, Elliot and Meggi decided to sublet their home in
      Calgary and drive across the country to live in Southern Ontario for a summer. They spent their time
      exploring Toronto’s food scene (which included trying to get through the <em>Top 20 Best Bowls of
        Ramen</em>). This adventure also gave Meg and Elliot an unforgettable Summer with the
      Marras! They spent most of their time playing pick-up basketball and hanging out in the backyard.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">After a fun-filled summer, Meg and El headed back to
      Calgary. The next two years became very busy with school and  work&mdash;they soon realized that they needed
      to make the most of their limited time together, so they decided to take weekend adventures whenever
      they could. These mini experiences would take them to Banff, Emerald Lake Lodge, and Santa Monica. One of
      their most memorable mini Alberta adventures was their trip up to Red Deer to get their puppers, Harper! It was a long drive home with a very nervous pup, but Meg and El were so excited their pack had just grown by one.</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">In 2016, Elliot finished school (again) and the
      couple decided that they would move to wherever the best opportunity was for him. After a few months of
      uncertainty they decided to move to Vancouver. The three of them packed up their home in Calgary and started out on their next adventure!</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure center fade">In Vancouver, El and Meg like to spend their time on the
      beach or hiking in the mountains. They also enjoy hopping on their bikes to check out local breweries and
      discover their new favorite craft beer.</p>
